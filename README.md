# Milk and Wool

## Description

A series of patches to ensure that all animals that could feasibly be milked or sheared can be, increasing the options for milk and wool!

Animals which would be harder to milk (those without a nice udder) give less milk than their similarly-sized counterparts, for both "realism" and balance.

**Patches for animal mods included!**

## Why?

I was upset that I couldn't shear wool from my woolly mammoths, or milk my woolly rhinoceroses.

## Currently Supported Animals

Milk and wool format: item/interval (amount per day)

Changes are in bold.

Big thanks to Bo (BOBACONLIVES!) for his mod Bo's Milkable Animals (<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=841092540>), which I used to learn how to do XML patching in RimWorld and as a reference for some milk values.

Another big thanks to Ferny, Harmonea, and all the helpful members of the Fernworld Discord server for helping me troubleshoot LoadFolders and whatnot.
